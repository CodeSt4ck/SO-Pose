# SO-Pose
This repository contains codes of ICCV2021 paper: SO-Pose: Exploiting Self-Occlusion for Direct 6D Pose Estimation
This paper is basically an incremental work to paper: GDR-Net: Geometry-Guided Direct Regression Network for Monocular 6D Object Pose Estimation.
We analyze and leverage self-occlusion in 6D pose estimation.

The code is incomplete now. We plan to release models and codes before 10.09.
